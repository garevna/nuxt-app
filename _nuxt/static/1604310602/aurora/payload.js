Our National Broadband Network is mostly Telstra and Optus’s old Telephone and PayTV cables repurposed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 That’s why the whole nation is plagued by network outages, and it’s why DGtek fibre is unmatched for reliability.\n        "};T[1]={question:"How is Pineapple Net Cheaper Than Every Other Internet Provider?",answer:"DGtek is cheaper for us to retail.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 As a new Aussie ISP, we’d struggle to retail the NBN. Unless your one of the big players, the so-called “open access” NBN is practically inaccessible.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 We pass these savings down to our customers.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 That’s why our 50Mbps plan is the cheapest on the market.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 And why our 150Mbps plan is less than any NBN 100 plan, although 50Mbps faster for downloads and 110Mbps faster for uploads.\u003Cbr\u003E\n        "};T[2]={question:"What are Symmetrical Speeds?",answer:"Symmetrical speeds are when your upload speeds are as fast as your download speeds.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 That means that a plan with 500Mbps download has 500Mbps uploads.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 You’ve probably noticed that all RSPs retailing the NBN talk about their downloads a lot more than their uploads. That’s because NBN uploads are a lot slower for residential connections.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 100Mbps\u002F40Mpbs --- 100Mbps download --- 40Mbps upload.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 While Pineapple Net retails symmetrical speeds.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 We do this because it’s easy. There is so much extra bandwidth with a full-fibre connection that we don’t need to limit our uploads. And we know it’s helpful for the work from home crowd, social and business video calls and will even save people time when they upload to social media.\n        "};T[3]={question:"What Can I Do With Fibre?",answer:"Nothing you couldn’t do with your NBN connection. It’s just an all-round better experience. You can download large files quicker, stream in higher resolutions, upload massive files in a fraction of the time and of course, fibre is way more reliable so you won’t drop calls to your work colleagues or loved ones.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 There is no evening congestion, no unexplainable internet slow days and practically no network outages.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 Since DGtek launched their fibre in 2016, our customers have enjoyed 99.9% network uptime.

The cables, the network and all the hardware are all completely separate. That’s why it’s impossible for Pineapple Fibre to affect your NBN connection. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EYou can keep your NBN landline or internet and have a Pineapple connection operating in parallel. Furthermore, since fibre doesn’t send data as radio waves (like a copper connection) it’s impossible for signals on a fibre cable to interfere with the data travelling along an NBN cable. "},{question:"How does the fibre connection process work?",answer:"Once a site survey confirms that installing fibre at your property is feasible, we’ll make a plan to run the fibre through a pit or dig a small trench to your home. Once we reach a wall, we’ll likely use conduit, the same colour as the wall, to take our fibre over to the ONT (optical network termination) device. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe ONT is mounted outside. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EInside we’ll mount a new wall plate. That’s where you’ll plug in your router or WiFi access point.  \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOn the surface, a Pineapple Fibre connection looks very similar to an NBN connection. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDepending on your current NBN technology you might have one less box cluttering up under the study desk, but from your perspective, it’s still a cable coming out the wall that plugs into a router and then into your phone or computer. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFor apartment buildings where our fibre is already available, the install process is much simpler. The ONT is already installed and operational in the comms room on your level. All we need to do is run a cable down the corridor and mount a new wall plate for you to plug your router into, and after some configuration, you’ll be good to go. "},{question:"Why do I need a site visit? ",answer:"Before connecting your home we need to visit the site and conduct a survey. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWe need to assess the feasibility of extending our network to your property. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs much as we’d like to, we can’t reach everyone in our network footprint with our fibre. There are a number of factors beyond our control that can get in the way. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOur fibre pit might be on the other side of the road. There might be structural complications within your property that make a fibre install very difficult. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWe might need permissions we can’t get from the local council to reach your property, or the cost to access your home via the nearest Telstra pits might be unreasonable. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA site survey is the only way we can tell for certain if we can go ahead with the install, and get you hooked up with our ultra-fast fibre in your home. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWe’ll book you into a 1-hour slot. Our technicians will arrive on time and they won’t take long to complete the site survey.
