Our National Broadband Network is mostly Telstra and Optus’s old Telephone and PayTV cables repurposed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 That’s why the whole nation is plagued by network outages, and it’s why DGtek fibre is unmatched for reliability.\n        "},{question:"How is Pineapple Net Cheaper Than Every Other Internet Provider?",answer:"DGtek is cheaper for us to retail.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 As a new Aussie ISP, we’d struggle to retail the NBN. Unless your one of the big players, the so-called “open access” NBN is practically inaccessible.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 We pass these savings down to our customers.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 That’s why our 50Mbps plan is the cheapest on the market.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 And why our 150Mbps plan is less than any NBN 100 plan, although 50Mbps faster for downloads and 110Mbps faster for uploads.\u003Cbr\u003E\n        "},{question:"What are Symmetrical Speeds?",answer:"Symmetrical speeds are when your upload speeds are as fast as your download speeds.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 That means that a plan with 500Mbps download has 500Mbps uploads.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 You’ve probably noticed that all RSPs retailing the NBN talk about their downloads a lot more than their uploads. That’s because NBN uploads are a lot slower for residential connections.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 100Mbps\u002F40Mpbs --- 100Mbps download --- 40Mbps upload.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 While Pineapple Net retails symmetrical speeds.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 We do this because it’s easy. There is so much extra bandwidth with a full-fibre connection that we don’t need to limit our uploads. And we know it’s helpful for the work from home crowd, social and business video calls and will even save people time when they upload to social media.\n        "},{question:"What Can I Do With Fibre?",answer:"Nothing you couldn’t do with your NBN connection. It’s just an all-round better experience. You can download large files quicker, stream in higher resolutions, upload massive files in a fraction of the time and of course, fibre is way more reliable so you won’t drop calls to your work colleagues or loved ones.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 There is no evening congestion, no unexplainable internet slow days and practically no network outages.\u003Cbr\u003E\n                 Since DGtek launched their fibre in 2016, our customers have enjoyed 99.9% network uptime. Years have passed without a single dropout. That feat is unthinkable on the NBN.\n        "}]}},modules:{},officeAddress:"75 Brighton Road, Elwood VIC 3184",officePhone:"1300 857 501",officeEmail:"info@pineapple.net.au",officeABN:"55 618 934 437",linkedIn:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.linkedin.com\u002Fcompany\u002Fpineapplenet\u002F",faceBook:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002FPineappleNetAU\u002F",footer:{topHead:"READY TO GET STARTED?",topText:"Leave your inquiry and we'll get back to you within 24 hours on business days",button:"GET STARTED",goto:"#top"}},serverRendered:a,routePath:"\u002Fqv1",config:{}}}(true,"#contact","Get in Touch","Conservatory"));
