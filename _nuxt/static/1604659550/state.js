The cables, the network and all the hardware are all completely separate. That’s why it’s impossible for Pineapple Fibre to affect your NBN connection. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EYou can keep your NBN landline or internet and have a Pineapple connection operating in parallel. Furthermore, since fibre doesn’t send data as radio waves (like a copper connection) it’s impossible for signals on a fibre cable to interfere with the data travelling along an NBN cable. "},{question:"How does the fibre connection process work?",answer:"Once a site survey confirms that installing fibre at your property is feasible, we’ll make a plan to run the fibre through a pit or dig a small trench to your home. Once we reach a wall, we’ll likely use conduit, the same colour as the wall, to take our fibre over to the ONT (optical network termination) device. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe ONT is mounted outside. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EInside we’ll mount a new wall plate. That’s where you’ll plug in your router or WiFi access point.  \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOn the surface, a Pineapple Fibre connection looks very similar to an NBN connection. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDepending on your current NBN technology you might have one less box cluttering up under the study desk, but from your perspective, it’s still a cable coming out the wall that plugs into a router and then into your phone or computer. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFor apartment buildings where our fibre is already available, the install process is much simpler. The ONT is already installed and operational in the comms room on your level. All we need to do is run a cable down the corridor and mount a new wall plate for you to plug your router into, and after some configuration, you’ll be good to go. "},{question:"Why do I need a site visit? ",answer:"Before connecting your home we need to visit the site and conduct a survey. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWe need to assess the feasibility of extending our network to your property. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs much as we’d like to, we can’t reach everyone in our network footprint with our fibre. There are a number of factors beyond our control that can get in the way. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOur fibre pit might be on the other side of the road. There might be structural complications within your property that make a fibre install very difficult. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWe might need permissions we can’t get from the local council to reach your property, or the cost to access your home via the nearest Telstra pits might be unreasonable. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA site survey is the only way we can tell for certain if we can go ahead with the install, and get you hooked up with our ultra-fast fibre in your home. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWe’ll book you into a 1-hour slot. Our technicians will arrive on time and they won’t take long to complete the site survey. If all goes well we can start drawing up a plan and get you connected in no time at all. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf you’re in an apartment building and your neighbours are already connected to Pineapple Net, it’s possible we can forgo the site survey and connect you immediately.\u003Cbr\u003E        "},{question:"What will it cost me to connect to the fibre network?",answer:"If we’ve done the site survey and determined that your install won’t require any extraneous work, we’ll connect you to our fibre network for free when you agree to a 12-month contract. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf you don’t want to commit to a 12-month contract, that’s fine, we’ll only charge you $99 for the connection.  \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA router and everything you need to get set up is included with both our 12-month contract and the $99 connection fee. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EYou do not have to use our router if you have your own, however, we do not take any responsibility for the maintenance of your router and there may be an extra charge for configuring it. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf you do purchase\u002Fown a router, please ensure it is able to support gigabit speeds (even our 150Mbps plan requires this). Have questions about router compatibility? You can always call us with the make and model, and we’ll be happy to help."},{question:"Are there any extra costs?",answer:"No. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPay that $99 fee to get connected and we’ll throw in everything you need. All those extras that other internet service providers (ISPs)  will charge you for, we do for free. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWe will configure you with a static ISP, throw in a router and even let you upgrade your speeds by moving up packages without paying service fees. All at no additional cost. "},{question:"How do I get 1 month for free?",answer:"Just sign up to Pineapple Net! \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESign up for pay-as-you-go or our 12-month contract and get the first month of 1000MBps internet for free. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIt’s that simple. Since we’ve also waved the connection fees and the router fees, on a 12-month contract you really won’t be a dollar out of pocket for the first month. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere’s nothing to it. "},{question:"If I’m not happy with my Pineapple connection, can I cancel?",answer:"You’d be the first.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Eif you’ve chosen the flexible month to month contract and paid the connection fee then you are free to cancel anytime you want. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf you’ve committed to a 12-month contract you’ll have to stay. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhile other internet service providers tend to connect and forget, we'll do everything we can to make you happy \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ELuckily, our ultra-fast fibre service is way better than any of our competitors, which explains why that, with the exception of a few customers who moved homes, no one has ever left Pineapple willingly.
